## 🔨 Lab Repositories (In Progress)

### 🔍 macOS Entitlement Audit (May 2025 – Present)
- Audited entitlements for 5 macOS Sonoma applications using codesign and plist parsing via custom Bash scripts.

- Extracted and analyzed sandbox permissions such as get-task-allow, disable-library-validation, and allow-dyld-environment-variables.

- Discovered 3 applications (Google Chrome, Postman, Zoom.us) with elevated entitlements posing potential security risks.

- Built a two-part scanning and detection system to automate entitlement discovery and flag suspicious configurations.

**Skills:** *macOS Security · Bash Scripting · Static Analysis · Permission Auditing · Application Hardening · Endpoint Security*

### 🛡️ Python Keylogger with Remote C2 Server (May 2025 – Present)
- Developed a cross-platform keylogger in Python using pynput, with support for screenshot capture and encrypted keystroke logs.

- Engineered a custom Flask-based C2 server to receive real-time keystroke data via HTTP POST in a controlled lab environment.

- Self-tested across 2 platforms (macOS, Linux) using VMware Workstation to simulate adversarial client-server communication.

- Designed for modularity and ethical use, including configuration flags, log filters, and a testing sandbox to ensure safe operation.

**Skills:** *Python · Offensive Security · Client-Server Architecture · Remote Monitoring · Ethical Hacking · Network Communication · Keylogging*
