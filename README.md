## 👋 Hey, I’m Isaiah  
I build and break systems to understand how they really work.  
My path started in **IT and programming**, and evolved into **cybersecurity** — where offense and defense meet.  
I’m most at home designing **labs that mimic real threats** and **detections that actually catch them**.  

Right now, I’m focused on purple team operations, automation, and cloud defense.

## 🧠 What I’ve Been Working On
- **Active Directory Lab** – domain controllers, simulated attacks, and custom detection rules  
- **macOS Audit Framework** – digging into Apple’s entitlement system to surface hidden telemetry  
- **Linux Priv-Esc Playground** – a sandbox for practicing privilege escalation and mitigation  
- **Infra Builds** – PXE boot, cloud VM provisioning, and segmented network designs
