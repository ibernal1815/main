## 👋 Hey, I’m Isaiah  
I build and break systems to see what really happens under the hood.  
My journey started in **IT and programming**, and evolved into **cybersecurity** — where curiosity meets precision.  
I focus on **building high-fidelity labs** that simulate real-world attacks and **engineering detections** that actually stop them.  

Right now, I’m deep into **Purple Team operations**, **automation**, and **cloud defense** — turning theory into measurable results.

## 🧠 Projects That Define My Work
- 🧩 **Active Directory Lab** – multi-domain setup, simulated attack chains, and custom detections built on ELK  
- 🍎 **macOS Audit Framework** – exploring Apple’s entitlement system and crafting telemetry-based detections  
- 🐧 **Linux Priv-Esc Playground** – dedicated sandbox for privilege escalation techniques and mitigations  
- ⚙️ **Infra Builds** – PXE boot automation, network segmentation, and scalable VM deployments across cloud platforms
