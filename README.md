<h2 align="center">👋 About Me</h2>

<p align="center">
I’m someone who learns by building, breaking, fixing, and understanding.  
My background blends <strong>IT operations</strong>, <strong>programming</strong>, and <strong>hands-on cybersecurity</strong>, and I’m driven by the idea that real skill comes from facing real challenges.  
<br><br>
I keep a friendly and collaborative approach, but I take the craft seriously.  
I like digging into the details most people overlook, and I’m comfortable working through the quiet, difficult parts of security work—the logs, the artifacts, the things that don’t give up answers easily.
<br><br>
Right now, I’m sharpening my Blue Team and Incident Response abilities while preparing for the kind of work where understanding the adversary matters just as much as defending against them.
